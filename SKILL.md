# Git Commit Messaging Skill

This skill assists in analyzing project changes and generating standardized, clear, and simple Git commit messages.

## Format Specification

The generated commit message MUST strictly follow this structure:
`branch-name - type - description`

Example:
`feature/login-system - feat - add user authentication logic`

The `type` and `description` MUST always be in English.

## 1. Extracting Context

When tasked with generating a commit message, follow these steps to gather the necessary context:

### Branch Name
Determine the current branch name. If the user hasn't provided it, you can retrieve it by running:
`git branch --show-current`

### Change Analysis
Analyze the modifications to understand the scope and nature of the work:
- Check modified files using `git status`.
- Review the actual code changes using `git diff` or `git diff --cached`.

## 2. Determining the Change `[type]`

Use standard Conventional Commits types to classify the work. These are the most universally understood categories. The type should be completely lowercase:

*   **feat**: A new feature (e.g., adding a new component, route, or functionality).
*   **fix**: A bug fix.
*   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (e.g., restructuring code, renaming variables).
*   **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
*   **style**: Formatting changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
*   **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   **chore**: Changes to the build process, auxiliary tools, or library dependencies.
*   **perf**: A code change that improves overall performance.

## 3. Formulating the `[description]`

The description is critical. It must adhere to the following principles to ensure it is the most understandable, most preferred, and uses simple language:

1.  **Use the Imperative Mood:** Always describe what the commit will do if applied. For example, use "add feature" instead of "added feature" or "adds feature".
2.  **Be Clear and Direct:** State exactly what the change achieves without using overly complex vocabulary. Skip unnecessary filler words.
3.  **Keep it Concise:** Try to keep the description under 50 characters. Focus on the "what" and "why". Leave the "how" for the diff itself.
4.  **Formatting Rules:** Start with a lowercase letter and do not end with a period.

### Good Examples:
- `handle null user object in auth service`
- `update jwt expiration time to 24 hours`
- `remove deprecated image processing library`

### Bad Examples:
- `Fixed that annoying bug where the user would sometimes get a null pointer if they tried to log in` (Too long, not imperative)
- `Updates the user model` (Not imperative, starts with capital letter)

## Example Workflow Run

1.  **User Request:** "Generate a commit message for my staged changes."
2.  **Action:** You run `git branch --show-current` -> Output is `bugfix/cart-calculation`
3.  **Action:** You run `git diff --cached` -> Output shows a corrected math formula in `CartService.java`.
4.  **Analysis:** The type is `fix`. The best description is `correct total price calculation logic`.
5.  **Output to User:** `bugfix/cart-calculation - fix - correct total price calculation logic`
